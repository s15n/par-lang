# Types

At the heart of Par lies its type system, representing linear logic.

## Named Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _NamedType_ : [ID] _TypeArguments_<sup>?</sup>

Defined via [type aliases](items.md#type-definitions), named types can always be replaced with their definition without changing meaning.

```par
let x: Option<T> = .none!
// is equivalent to
let x: either { .none!, .some T } = .none!
```

## The Unit Type

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _Unit_ : `!`

*<sup>
[Dual](#the-bottom-type)
| [Constructing Expression](./expressions/construction.md#the-unit-expression)
| [Pattern](./patterns.md#the-unit-pattern)
| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#the-break-command)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#the-continue-command)
</sup>*

Unit is a type providing no information. In C(++) it's called `void`, in Rust it's `()` (and it can be thought of as an empty tuple in Par as well). There is exactly one value of type `!`, and it's also `!`.
```par
let unit: ! = !
```
Every value of a type `A` corresponds to a function `[!] A`:
```par
def select: [type T] [T] [!] T = [type T] [x] [!] x
// uncurrying makes this clear
// [T] [!] T = [T, !] T ≅ [(T) !] T ≅ [T] T

def extract: [type T] [[!] T] T = [type T] [f] f(!)
```

For some types there is a function `[A] !`. 
Those can be destroyed.
```par
// Types constructed only from ! are droppable
def drop_bool: [Bool] ! = [b] b {
  .true! => !
  .false! => !
}

// Functions are not droppable in general
def drop_impossible: [[Bool] Bool] ! = todo
```

`!` is [data](./linearity.md#data).

In linear logic, `!` is \\(\mathbf{1}\\), the unit for \\(\otimes\\).

## Pair Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _PairType_ : `(` _TypeList_ `)` _Type_

*<sup>
[Dual](#function-types)
| [Constructing Expression](./expressions/construction.md#pair-expressions)
| [Pattern](./patterns.md#pair-patterns)
| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#send-commands)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#receive-commands)
</sup>*

Having multiple types between `(` and `)` is just syntax sugar:
```par
type T = (A, B) R
// is equivalent to
type T = (A) (B) R
```

While `(A, B)!` and `(A) B` are both valid ways to define a pair of `A` and `B`, depending on the context, one might be more convenient than the other:
```par
// convert (A, B)! into (A) B
def i : [(A, B)!] (A) B = [x]
  let (a, b)! = x in (a) b
// and back
def j : [(A) B] (A, B)! = [x]
  let (a) b = x in (a, b)!

// a good use case of (A) B
type List<T> = recursive either {
  .empty!
  .item(T) self
}
// can now be created like this:
let bool_list: List<Bool> =
  .item(.true!).item(.false!).empty!

// in most cases, (A, B)! is the safer bet
// as it uses more friendly syntax
type Pair<T, T> = (T, T)!

let bool_pair: Pair<Bool> =
  (.true!, .false!)!
```
In general, `(A, B)!` should be prefered.

Values are created using [pair expressions](./expressions/construction.md#pair-expressions):
```par
let a: A = ...
let b: B = ...

let pair: (A) B = (a) b
```
and they can be destructed using [pair patterns]() or [receive commands]():
```par
let triple: (A, B, C)! = (a, b, c)!

// pattern matching
let (first) rest = triple
// first = a
// rest = (b, c)!

// commands
do {
  rest[second]
  // after this command:
  // rest = (c)! 
  // second = b
} in ...
```

If `A` and `B` are data, `(A) B` is [data](./linearity.md#data) as well.

In linear logic, `(A) B` is \\(A \otimes B\\). For session types, it means "send `A` and continue as `B`".

## Function Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _FunctionType_ : `[` _TypeList_ `]` _Type_

*<sup>
[Dual](#pair-types)
| [Constructing Expression](./expressions/construction.md#function-expressions)

| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#receive-commands)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#send-commands)
</sup>*

Having multiple types between `[` and `]` is just syntax sugar:
```par
type T = [A, B] R
// is equivalent to
type T = [A] [B] R
```

Values are created using [function expressions](./expressions/construction.md#function-expressions):
```par
let add1: [Nat] Nat = [n] .succ n
```
and destructed by [calling](./expressions/application.md#function-calls) the function:
```par
let one: Nat = .succ.zero!
let two = add1(one)
```

In linear logic, `[A] B` is a [linear](./linearity.md) function \\(A \multimap B\\). For session types, it means "receive `A` and continue as `B`".

## Either Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _EitherType_ : `either` `{` (_Label_ _Type_ `,`<sup>?</sup>)<sup>\*</sup> `}`

*<sup>
[Dual](#choice-types)
| [Constructing Expression](./expressions/construction.md#either-selections)
| [Destructing Expression](./expressions/application.md#either-destructions)
| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#signal-commands)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#match-commands)
</sup>*

An either type is the usual sum type aka. a tagged union (in Rust, it's an `enum`). Every value of such a type consists of a label, marking the variant, and a value of the type corresponding to the label (its "payload").

```par
// the most basic sum type
type Bool = either {
  .true!  // variant "true" with payload !
  .false! // variant "false", also with payload !
}

// a slightly more complex example
type TwoOrNone<T> = either {
  .none!      // variant "none" with "no" payload (using !)
  .two(T, T)! // variant "some" with "two" payloads
}
```

Values are created by attaching a label to its required payload.
Note that the corresponding either type must always be known when labeling an expression. A [type annotation]() can be used for that.
```par
let no_bool: TwoOrNone<Bool> = .none!

let both_bools: TwoOrNone<Bool> = .two(.true!, .false!)!
```

If `A` and `B` are data, `either { .a A, .b B}` is [data](./linearity.md#data) as well. For example, `Bool` is data:
```par
def and: [Bool, Bool] Bool = [b1, b2] b1 {
  .true! => b2,
  .false! => .false! // b2 gets dropped implicitly here
}
```

In linear logic, `either { .a A, .b B }` is \\(A \oplus B\\). For session types, it means "select from `A` or `B`".
An empty either type `either {}` is therefore \\(\mathbf{0}\\), the empty type.
In Haskell, it's called `void` and in Rust it's `!` (not to be confused with the `!` in Par). 
There is a function from it to every type:
```par
def absurd: [type T] [either {}] T = [type T] [x] x {}
```
This function can never be called though.

Either types are often used as [recursive](#recursive-types) types.

## Choice Types

*<sup>
[Dual](#either-types)
| [Constructing Expression](./expressions/construction.md#choice-constructions)
| [Destructing Expression](./expressions/application.md#choice-selections)
| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#match-commands)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#signal-commands)
</sup>*

A choice type is dual to an [either](#either-types) type. Constructing a value of an either type is "making a choice" and similarly, destructing such a value looks exactly like constructing a value of a choice type.
It consists of several labels that can be used as signals to destruct the receiver.

```par
// choice of two
type If<A, B> = {
  .true => A
  .false => B
}

// destruct a Bool
def negate(b: Bool): Bool = b {
  .true! => .false!
  .false! => .true!
}

// construct a choice
def negate_choice: If<Bool, Bool> = {
  .true => .false!
  .false => .true!
}

// define negate using the choice
// featuring selecting from the choice type value
def also_negate: [Bool] Bool = [b] b {
  .true! => negate_choice.true
  .false! => negate_choice.false
}
```
`.cons => [A] B` can also be written as `.cons(A) => B`

A choice type represents an interface for interacting with data. While an either type describes its underlying data, a choice type describes what can be done with it.
```par
// creating an interface
type Stack<T, Unwrap> = iterative {
  .push(T) => self
  .pop => (Option<T>) self
  .unwrap => Unwrap
}

// implementing it
dec list_stack : [type T] [List<T>] Stack<T, List<T>>
def list_stack = [type T] [list] begin {
  .push(x) => let list: List<T> = .item(x) list in loop
  .pop => list {
    .empty! => (.none!) let list: List<T> = .empty! in loop,
    .item(head) tail => (.some head) let list = tail in loop
  }
  .unwrap => list
}

def main = do {
  let stack = list_stack(type Bool)(.empty!)
  stack.push(.true!)
  stack.push(.false!)
} in stack
```
For an explanation of `iterative`-`self` and `begin`-`loop`, see [iterative types](#iterative-types)

In linear logic, `{ .a => A, .b => B }` is \\(A \mathbin{\\&} B\\). For session types, it means "offer a choice of `A` or `B`".
An empty choice `{}` is therefore \\(\top\\) and has exactly one value, `{}`. There is a function to it from every type:
```par
def immortalize: [type T] [T] {} = [type T] [x] {}
```
The result of this function can never be used though.

Choice types are often used as [iterative](#iterative-types) types.

## Recursive Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _RecursiveType_ : `recursive` [_LoopLabel_]<sup>?</sup> _Type_

*<sup>
[Dual](#iterative-types)
| [Destructing Expression](./expressions/application.md#recursive-destructions)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#recursive-commands)
</sup>*

A recursive type can be used within itself via `self`.

If no loop label is present, `self` corresponds to the innermost `recursive`/`iterative`. Else to the one with the same loop label.

Recursive types are mostly used in conjunction with either types:
```par
type List<T> = recursive either {
  .empty!
  .item(T) self
}
```
<!--// another way of defining a recursive type is the following:
// Node is not recursive
type Node<Next> = either {
  .base!
  .step Next
}
// Defining the recursive type
type Rec = recursive Node<self>

// We have the following subtyping relation:
// Node<recursive Node<self>> <: recursive Node<self>-->

Values of recursive types always terminate. They have to be constructed finitely.
```par
// a simple List
let l: List<Bool> = .item(.true!).item(.false!).empty!
```

If `D` is data (assuming `self` is data), `recursive D` is [data](./linearity.md#data) as well. For example, `Nat` is data:
```par
def descending_nats: [Nat] List<Nat> = [n] n begin {
  .zero! => .empty!,
  .succ p1 => .item(.succ p1) p1 loop // p1 gets implicitly copied here
}
```

Mathematically, a recursive either type represents an inductive type.
Constructors without `self` are the base cases while those with `self` represent
inductive steps.

A function from a recursive type is defined using induction:
```par
// recursive (inductive) type representing
// the natural numbers
type Nat = recursive either { 
  .zero!, 
  .succ self
}

dec is_even : [Nat] Bool
// induction over n (marked by applying begin-loop)
def is_even = [n] n begin {
  // base case(s)
  .zero! => .true!
  // inductive step(s)
  // pred loop is analogous to an inductive hypothesis
  .succ pred => not(pred loop)
}
```

## Iterative Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _IterativeType_ : `iterative` [_LoopLabel_]<sup>?</sup> _Type_

*<sup>
[Dual](#recursive-types)
| [Constructing Expression](./expressions/construction.md#iterative-constructions)
| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#recursive-commands)
</sup>*

An iterative type can be used within itself via `self`.

If no loop label is present, `self` corresponds to the innermost `recursive`/`iterative`. Else to the one with the same loop label.

Iterative types are mostly used in conjunction with choice types, for example:
<!--```par
type Repl<T> = iterative {
  .copy => (self, self)!
  .drop => !
  .unwrap => T
}
```-->
```par
type Stream<T> = iterative {
  .close => !
  .next => (T) self
}
```

<!--Here we construct a value of an iterative type. Note the similarity
between this and destructing a recursive type.
```par
?type Bool = either { .true!, .false! }
?type Nat = recursive either { .zero!, .succ self }
?type List<T> = recursive either { .empty!, .item(T) self }
?
// construct a list of Repl<Bool>
// i.e. a value of a recursive type
//
// at the same time, destruct a value
// of the recursive type Nat
dec repeat : [Nat, Repl<Bool>] List<Bool>
def repeat = [n, b] n begin {
  .zero! => do { b.drop? } in .empty!
  .succ pred => let (b, c)! = b.copy in .item(c.unwrap) pred loop
}

// construct a value of the iterative Repl<Bool>
dec repl_bool : [Bool] Repl<Bool>
def repl_bool = [b] begin {
  .copy => b {
    .true! => (let b: Bool = .true! in loop, let b: Bool = .true! in loop)!
    .false! => (let b: Bool = .false! in loop, let b: Bool = .false! in loop)!
  }
  .drop => b {
    .true! => !
    .false! => !
  }
  .unwrap => b
}
?
?def main = repeat(.succ.succ.succ.zero!, repl_bool(.true!))
```-->

Values of iterative types may be infinite. In contrast to recursive types, such values can only be _destructed_ in finitely many steps.
```par
type Inf<T> = iterative (T) self

def infinite_bools: Inf<Bool> = begin (.true!) loop
```
This infinite value can be constructed but there is no way of fully destructing (so: using) it.

If `D` is data (assuming `self` is data), `iterative D` is also [data](./linearity.md#data).

Mathematically, an iterative choice type represents a coinductive type.
Destructors without `loop` break the iteration and return, while those containing `loop` yield and continue.

A function to an iterative type is defined using coinduction (iteration):
<!--```par
// iterative (coinductive) type representing
// an infinite stream
type Stream<T> = iterative { 
  .close => !, 
  .next => (T) self
}

dec alternate_true_false : [Nat] Bool
// induction over n (marked by applying begin-loop to n)
def is_even = [n] n begin {
  // base case(s)
  .zero! => .true!
  // inductive step(s)
  .succ pred => not(pred loop)
}
```-->
<!--```par
// construct a value of the iterative Repl<Bool>
dec repl_bool : [Bool] Repl<Bool>
// coinduction (marked by an independent begin-loop)
def repl_bool = [b] begin {
  // yield "(b, b)" and
  // continue (coinductive step), written as `loop`
  .copy => b {
    .true! => (let b: Bool = .true! in loop, let b: Bool = .true! in loop)!
    .false! => (let b: Bool = .false! in loop, let b: Bool = .false! in loop)!
  }
  // break, yield !
  .drop => b {
    .true! => !
    .false! => !
  }
  // break, yield b
  .unwrap => b
}
```-->
```par
?type Nat = recursive either { .zero!, .succ self }
?
// construct a stream of all natural numbers
// in form of the iterative Stream<Nat>
def nat_stream: Stream<Nat> = 
  let n: Nat = .zero! in 
  // coinduction (independent begin-loop)
  begin {
    // break, return !
    .close => drop(n),

    .next => do {
      let (next, n)! = copy(n)
      let n: Nat = .succ n
    } in
      // yield the next number 
      (n1)
      // continue (coinductive step)
      loop 
  }

// helpers

def drop: [Nat] ! = [n] n begin {
  .zero! => !
  .succ pred => pred loop
}

def copy: [Nat] (Nat, Nat)! = [n] n begin {
  .zero! => (.zero!, .zero!)!
  .succ pred => let (p1, p2)! = pred loop
    in (.succ p1, .succ p2)!
}
```
<!--```par
// fibonacci sequence
def fib: Stream<Nat> = do {
  let n: Nat  = .succ.zero!
  let p: Nat = .succ.zero!
  // coinduction
} in begin {
    // break, return !
    .close => do {
      drop(n)?
      drop(p)?
    } in !

    .next => do {
      let (n1, n2)! = copy(n)
      let (p1, p2)! = copy(p)
      let p = n1
      let n = add(n2, p2)
    } in
      // yield
      (p1)
      // continue
      loop
  }
def add: [Nat, Nat] Nat = [a, b] a begin {
  .zero! => b,
  .succ pred => .succ pred loop
}

## Existential Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _ExistentialType_ : `(` `type` [_ID_List_] `)` _Type_

*<sup>
[Dual](#universal-types)
| [Constructing Expression](./expressions/construction.md#existential-constructions)
| [Pattern](./patterns.md#existential-patterns)
| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#send-type-commands)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#receive-type-commands)
</sup>*

Having multiple types between `(` and `)` is just syntax sugar:
```par
type T = (type A, B) X
// is equivalent to
type T = (type A) (type B) X
```

Existential types mirror pair types but they're qualified over types rather than values.
They are used to encapsulate their underlying type.
```par
?type Bool  = either { .true!, .false! }
?type Nat = recursive either { .zero!, .succ self }
?
type Any = (type T) T

?def main = chan user {
// create values of the existential Any type
// note that both have exactly the same type!
let any1: Any = (type Bool) .true!
let any2: Any = (type Nat) .succ.zero!
?
?user(any1)
?user(any2)
?user!
?}
```

The qualifying types and values can both be extracted from a value of such a type:
```par
let any: Any = ...
let (type X) x = any
let y: X = x
```

If `D` is data, `(type T) D` is also [data](./linearity.md#data).

In linear logic, `(type T) A` is \\(\exists\ T: A\\).

## Universal Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _UniversalType_ : `[` `type` [_ID_List_] `]` _Type_

*<sup>
[Dual](#existential-types)
| [Constructing Expression](./expressions/construction.md#universal-constructions)
| [Destructing Expression](./expressions/application.md#universal-specializations)
| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#receive-type-commands)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#send-type-commands)
</sup>*

Having multiple types between `[` and `]` is just syntax sugar:
```par
type T = [type A, B] X
// is equivalent to
type T = [type A] [type B] X
```

Values of universal types can be instantiated for any type. These types syntactically mirror function types but they're qualified over types rather than values.
They're also similar to parameterized types.
```par
// compare the three types of parameterizing types
type UnivEndo = [type T] [T] T
type ParamEndo<T> = [T] T
type ExistEndo = (type T) [T] T

// a value of an universal type must be defined
// for all types
let id: UnivEndo = [type T] [x] x

// a specialized version can be represented using
// a parameterized type
let id_bool: ParamEndo<Bool> = id(type Bool)

// this type encapsulates the Bool
let id_bool_2: ExistEndo = (type Bool) id_bool
```
A more interesting example is [reversing a list](./expressions.md#channel-expressions) of any type.

If `D` is data, `[type T] D` is also [data](./linearity.md#data).

In linear logic, `[type T] A` is \\(\forall\ T: A\\).

## The Bottom Type

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _Bottom_ : `?`

*<sup>
[Dual](#the-unit-type)
| [Constructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#the-continue-command)
| [Destructing Statement](./statements/commands.md#the-break-command)
</sup>*

The bottom `?` is dual to the unit `!`.
```par
def main: Bool = chan user {
  user.true
  // user now has type ?
  user!
}
```

In linear logic, `?` is \\(\bot\\), the unit for \\(⅋\\). So \\(\bot \mathbin{⅋} A = \mathbf{1} \multimap A \cong A\\) (as seen before for the [unit](#the-unit-type) type).

## Channel Types

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _ChannelType_ : `chan` _Type_

*<sup>
[Dual](#types)
| [Constructing Expression](expressions.md#channel-expressions)
</sup>*

`chan A` represents a channel accepting an `A`:
```par
def just_true: Bool = chan yield {
  let c: chan Bool = yield
  c.true!
}
```
`chan` is merely a type transformer, turning a type into its dual.
For example, `chan chan T` is _equal_ to `T` (not just isomorphic).

A more elaborate example can be seen [here](https://github.com/faiface/par-lang/blob/main/examples/flatten.par)

A `chan A` can be linked with an `A` (using `<>`), annihilating both and ending the process.
```par
def just_true: Bool = chan yield {
  let c: chan Bool = yield
  let b: Bool = .true!
  c <> b
}
```
Note that `b <> c` would have been equally valid.

## Duality equations

In linear logic, `chan A` is \\(A^\perp\\), i.e. the dual type to `A`. Every type has a dual. These are defined according to this table:

| Type | Dual |
| ---- | ---- |
| `T` | `chan T` |
| `chan T` | `T` |
| `(A) B` | `[A] chan B` |
| `[A] B` | `(A) chan B` |
| `either { .a A, .b B }` | `{ .a => chan A, .b => chan B }` |
| `{ .a => A, .b => B }` | `either { .a chan A, .b chan B }` |
| `!` | `?` |
| `?` | `!` |
| `recursive T` | `iterative chan T` |
| `iterative T` | `recursive chan T` |
| `self` | `self` |
| `(type T) A` | `[type T] chan A` |
| `[type T] A` | `(type T) chan A` |

Moreover, `chan A ≅ [A]?` is an isomorphism
```par
dec i : [type A] [chan A] [A]?
def i = [type A] [ch] chan receive {
  // receive is of type (A)!
  receive[a]?
  ch <> a
}

dec j : [type A] [[A]?] chan A
def j = [type A] [annihilate] chan a {
  // a is of type A
  annihilate(a)!
}
```

So the dual of a type can be used to destruct a value.
